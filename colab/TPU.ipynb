        "| Hybrid    | Hybrid models are a blend between different styles, for example they are trained on both Novel stories and Adventure stories. These models are great variety models that you can use for multiple different playstyles and modes, but depending on your usage you may need to enable Adventure Mode or the You bias (in userscripts). |\n",
        "| Generic   | Generic models are not trained towards anything specific, typically used as a basis for other tasks and models. They can do everything the other models can do, but require much more handholding to work properly. Generic models are an ideal basis for tasks that we have no specific model for, or for experiencing a softprompt in its raw form. |\n",

        "## How to start KoboldAI in 7 simple steps\n",
        "Using KoboldAI on Google Colab is easy! Simply follow these steps to get started:\n",
        "1. Mobile phone? Tap the play button below next to \"<--- Tap this if you play on mobile\" to reveal an audio player, play the silent audio to keep the tab alive so Google will not shut you down when your using KoboldAI. If no audio player is revealed your phone browser does not support Google Colab in the mobile view, go to your browser menu and enable Desktop mode before you continue.\n",
        "2. Select the model that most describes what you would like to do, by default we have the most recommended model for people willing to try out KoboldAI selected.\n",
        "3. Click the play button next to \"<--- Click this to start KoboldAI\".\n",
        "4. Allow Google Drive access, this typically happens trough a popup but sometimes Google Drive access may be requested trough the older method by asking you to click on a link and copy a code. This is normal behavior for Colab and only you will get access to your files, nothing is shared with us.\n",
        "5. Now the automatic installation and Download process starts, for most models in the TPU edition expect the loading to take between 15 and 30 minutes on average depending on the current Colab download speeds and the model you selected. These downloads happen trough Google's internet connection, you will not be billed by your internet provider and it will not count towards any download limits.\n",
        "6. After waiting a Trycloudflare link appears, click the link to enjoy KoboldAI. If you get a 1033 error Cloudflare is not done loading, in that case keep refreshing until it goes away. (If it keeps happening after 2 minutes Cloudflare has an issue, in that case you can use Runtime -> Restart and Run All to get a new link).\n",
        "7. As you play KoboldAI, keep this Colab tab open in the background and check occationally for Captcha's so they do not shut your instance down. If you do get shut down you can always download a copy of your gamesave in the Save menu inside KoboldAI. Stories are never lost as long as you keep KoboldAI open in your browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "Get a error message saying you do not have access to a GPU/TPU instance? Do not continue and try again later, KoboldAI will not run correctly without them.\n",
