        "KoboldAI is a powerful and easy way to use a variety of AI based text generation experiences. You can use it to write stories, blog posts, play a text adventure game, use it like a chatbot and more! In some cases it might even help you with an assignment or programming task (But always make sure the information the AI mentions is correct, it loves to make stuff up).\n",

Then tap the play button next to \"<-- Tap This if you play on Mobile\", you will see an audio player. Keep the audio player playing so Colab does not get shut down in the background.\n",
        "2. Select the desired model, you will find a description of all the available models further down the page.\n",
        "3. Click the play button next to \"<-- Select your model below and then click this to start KoboldAI\".\n",
        "4. Got a message saying no accelerator is available? Click cancel, and try again in a few minutes. If you do not manage to get a session when you frequently try again try at a different time of day, colab can be busy or your priority may have been lowered by frequent usage.\n",
        "5. After everything is done loading you will get a link that you can use to open KoboldAI. In case of Localtunnel you will also be warned that some people are abusing Localtunnel for phishing, once you acknowledge this warning you will be taken to KoboldAI's interface. If you picked Cloudflare and get a 1033 error refresh the error page after waiting one minute.\n",

The end result is a very diverse model that is heavily biased towards SFW novel writing, but one that can go beyond its novel training and make for an excellent adventure model to. Adventure mode is best played from a second person perspective, but can be played in first or third person as well. Novel writing can be done best from the first or third person. |\n",

This model is capable of replacing both the Lit and Shinen models in terms of content and style and has been well received as (one of) the best NSFW models out there. If you wish to use this model for commercial or non research usage we recommend choosing the 20B version as that one is not subject to the restrictive OPT license. |\n",

        "1. Mobile phone? Tap the play button below next to \"<--- Tap this if you play on mobile\" to reveal an audio player, play the silent audio to keep the tab alive so Google will not shut you down when your using KoboldAI. If no audio player is revealed your phone browser does not support Google Colab in the mobile view, go to your browser menu and enable Desktop mode before you continue.\n",

If you are an advanced user you can also type any GPT model name from Huggingface.co to load this up (Unlisted Models may or may not work depending on Colab's hardware limitations).\n",
